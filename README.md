<h2 align="center">First Aid Guide</h2>

Summary: **Connecting individuals with useful first aid treatments, specialized doctors, and more**

<h2>Project idea and Structure</h2>

## Introduction
First aid can be administered in a variety of ways. When someone requires basic first aid, it's always a good idea to be prepared.

## Inspiration
Our team was inspired by the fast-growing healthcare innovation and medical sector using technology to a better future for human beings.

We aim to protect and support each other in our own communities and worldwide, particularly those people who need us.

## Problem Statement
With the guided demonstration, you will learn all of the available ways to use standard medical practices to provide first aid in various situations.

## How we built it 
Our App, First Aid App is built in Flutter (a cross-platform framework developed by Google) using DART programming language, for guiding people about basic first aid and other medical techniques as well as finding the best possible Doctors and hospitals.

**App Name** : 1AID

## Challenges
It was difficult to work across three different time zones.

We're all new to hackathons, so that was a big challenge!

We encountered creating and fetching Doctors and Hospitals API using public datasets, but we found out that their API has pricing to use. We decided to reduce the scope of the project to deal with the issues.


## Accomplishment
 We got the bare bones of our application and the code to work better.

## Learned something new:
We learned to work as a team. Learned about the new Flutter framework and DART. Learned about connecting the workflow of the git version control in the team.

## What's next for '1AID'?
We have a lot of work to do to bring the First Aid and its concept to fruition.
